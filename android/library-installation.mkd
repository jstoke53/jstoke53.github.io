The OpenXC functionality is exposed via a Java library that includes some
Android services your application can use. The library is available on GitHub in
the [openxc-android][] repository and the latest stable version is also in the`openxc-android` 
JCenter repository (which can be used in any Android Studio project just
by adding a line to your `build.gradle`).

Follow Google's excellent instructions to
[download and install Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

Add the `openxc` library to your project's dependencies in the `app/build.gradle`
file:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.openxcplatform:library:7.0.6'
    }

That's it! You can now proceed to the next steps to start using the library in
your project.

Note: If you need to include the OpenXC library on your local machine, please follow the instructions in the "Using the Library" section of the [App Tutorial page](http://openxcplatform.com/android/tutorial.html).

Clone the [openxc-android][] repository using Git. If you don't already have Git
installed, GitHub has a [good
reference](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for all platforms.

After cloning the `openxc-android` library, open the project in Android Studio.
You should be able to point it at the `openxc-android` directory to open an
existing project. The project includes 2 modules: the library and the Enabler
app.

Once you have the library set up, you can start writing your first OpenXC
app using the [App Tutorial](/android/tutorial.html). If you are having trouble, check out the
[troubleshooting](/android/troubleshooting.html) steps.
